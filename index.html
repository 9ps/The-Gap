            <h2>The Hidden Reality of Female Infanticide in India</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="t a_text padbottom">
            <p><br>
            In early infancy, <i> “girls have a biological advantage against many causes of death” (Sawyer) </i>. These universal biological factors mean that girls tend to have a higher chance of living to the age of five than boys.
            <br><br>
            Yet India dramatically bucks away from this trend, the divergence between male and female mortality rates <em> 4.3 standard deviations </em> from the mean. It is <em> one of two countries </em> where the female infant mortality rate is higher than the male. In conventional measures of Infant Mortality Rates, this reality is hidden, where <em> India has a 135 / 195 ranking. </em>
            <br><br>
            <div class= "note">
            Note: The other outlier is Tonga, with a population of 100,000. It consistently reports the highest male privileging mortality ratio, 8.5 Standard Deviations from the mean in 2019, while no discussion exists of this phenomena in popular literature.
            </div>
            <br><br>
            While other countries have had infant mortality rates that privilege boys, none have remained consistently high as India.

            <h2>The History</h2>
            <p>
            The trajectory of India’s infant mortality gender disparity, saw a worsening in the 1990’s from an already low historic baseline. It reached its <em> worst point in 2003, at a time when global gender disparity was increasing. </em> This is unlike the rest of the world, where historic gender disparities in infant mortality recovered by 1980 at the latest. 
            <br><br>
            The metric of Male to Female Infant Survival Rates, outside of natural causes, are affected by:  
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A greater tendency for the neglect of girls over boys, leading to excess fatalities</li>
                <li><em> Female Infantacide: </em> The intentional killing of infant girls, because they are girls</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="t quote">
            <p>"What do you think this girl will face? She can't run around with a pair of shorts like a boy can, she has to cover herself. I have to protect her. I have to manufacture her dowry from God knows where. ... She has nothing but suffering ahead of her  ...  It's not going to change. So tell me, am I mad, or what is wrong with my killing this child?"</p>

        </div>

        <div class="d_text b mid">
            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <p>
            Solutions to the disparity require means to dismantle systems of oppression and incentivise girls lives. Solutions need to address the ingrained social norms that uniquely continue inequality - counteract the dowry system, provide women and girls with greater agency and power.
            <br><br>
            <em class="em">Legalistic solutions</em>, like the prevention of ultrasound gender identification, banning of the dowry, have no impact due to their <em class="em">lack of enforcement.</em> Policies that don’t challenge the status quo, like the <em class="em">1992 Cradle Babies Program</em> - scheme for parents to give up their unwanted infants to government health centers- <i>“have had limited success … as parents have simply adopted different methods of killing baby girls”.</i>
            <br><br>
            <h3>Cash transfer based solutions:</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Schemes such as the <em class="em">2008 Dhanalakshmi Scheme</em>, which provided cash payments to the families of girls that carry out necessary tasks (birth registration, immunization, completion of primary school, etc.). These policies have seen more progressive attitudes of beneficiary parents, and enhance the agency and position of girls.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Education based solutions:</h3>
            <ul>
            <li><em class="em">Care for Girls campaign</em> in China, assisted with a decline in male-dominated sex ratio at birth. It is a composite solution: consisting of small loans for daughter only families, while also providing health examinations, education, and training with "modern production skills", that provide an economic incentive to having a daughter.</li>
            <li>NGOs within India mirror these programs providing <i>"counseling to expectant mothers, monetary incentives and childcare support, health education"</i>, which have been important drivers of improving female infant mortality rates.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Inventing the Future</h2>
            <p>
            Forecasting from the last 30 years, we can extend current trends to 2049. Due to the historic gender disparity of infant mortality, and recent success of current programs, the rate of change is quite high. It is predicted that:
            <ul>
            <li>In <em class="em">2022</em>, the rate at which infant girls and boys die will be even.</li>
            <li>By <em class="em">2023</em>, the rate will reach the median rate of 120 boys per 100 girls dying.</li>
            <li>Finally, in <em class="em">2049</em>, India is predicted to reach an combined Infant mortality rate of 0, representative of whatever the “natural” rate of child mortality is, dependent on advances in medical technology.</li>
            </ul>
