            <h2>The Hidden Reality of Female Infanticide in India</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="t a_text padbottom">
            <p><br>
            In early infancy, <i> “girls have a biological advantage against many causes of death”</i> [1]. These universal biological factors mean that girls tend to have a higher chance of living to the age of five than boys.
            <br><br>
            Yet India dramatically bucks away from this trend, the divergence between male and female mortality rates <em> 4.3 standard deviations </em> from the mean. It is <em> one of two countries </em> where the female infant mortality rate is higher than the male. In conventional measures of Infant Mortality Rates, this reality is hidden, where <em> India has a less concerning 135 / 195 ranking. </em>
            <br><br>
            <div class= "note">
            Note: The other outlier is Tonga, with a population of 100,000. It consistently reports the highest male privileging mortality ratio, 8.5 Standard Deviations from the mean in 2019, while no discussion exists of this phenomenon in popular literature.
            </div>
            <br>
            While other countries have had infant mortality rates that privilege boys, none have remained consistently high as India.

        <div class="t b_text padbottom">
            <h2>The History</h2>
            <p>
            The trajectory of India’s infant mortality gender disparity, saw a worsening in the 1990’s from an already low historic baseline. It reached its <em> worst point in 2003, at a time when global gender disparity was increasing. </em> This is unlike the rest of the world, where historic gender disparities in infant mortality recovered by 1980 at the latest. 
            <br><br>
            The metric of Male to Female Infant Survival Rates, outside of natural causes, are affected by:  
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A greater tendency for the neglect of girls over boys, leading to excess fatalities.</li>
                <li><em> Female Infanticide: </em> The intentional killing of infant girls, because they are girls.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="t quote">
            <p>"What do you think this girl will face? She can't run around with a pair of shorts like a boy can, she has to cover herself. I have to protect her. I have to manufacture her dowry from God knows where. ... She has nothing but suffering ahead of her  ...  It's not going to change. So tell me, am I mad, or what is wrong with my killing this child?"</p>

        <div class="c_text mid">
            <h2>The Factors</h2>
            <p>
            The quote above reveals how many separate factors contribute to the continuation of female infantacide, to the point where having a girl is unthinkable. While some contributing factors are shared by other countries, the exaggerated extent of the practice within India is contingent on the social and economic enforcement of patriarchy, that has been supported by technological advances. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="d_text b mid">
            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <p>
            Solutions to the disparity require means to dismantle systems of oppression and incentivise girls' lives. Solutions need to address the ingrained social norms that uniquely continue inequality - counteract the dowry system, provide women and girls with greater agency and power.
            <br><br>
            Legalistic solutions, like the prevention of ultrasound gender identification, banning of the dowry, have no impact due to their lack of enforcement. Policies that don’t challenge the status quo, like the <em class="em"> 1992 Cradle Babies Program </em> -- a scheme for parents to give up their unwanted infants to government health centres -- <i>“have had limited success … as parents have simply adopted different methods of killing baby girls”</i> [8].
            <br><br>
            <h3>Cash Transfer-based solutions:</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Schemes such as the <em class="em"> 2008 Dhanalakshmi Scheme </em>, which provided cash payments to the families of girls that carry out necessary tasks (birth registration, immunization, completion of primary school, etc.). These policies have seen more progressive attitudes of beneficiary parents, and enhance the agency and position of girls.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Education based solutions:</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>The <em class="em"> 2006 Care for Girls Campaign </em> in China, assisted with a decline in male-dominated sex ratio at birth. It is a composite solution: consisting of small loans for daughter only families, while also providing health examinations, education, and training that provide an economic incentive to having a daughter.</li>
            <li>NGOs within India mirror these programs providing <i>"counseling to expectant mothers, monetary incentives and childcare support, health education"</i> [8], which have been important drivers of improving female infant mortality rates.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Inventing the Future</h2>
            <p>
            Looking at trends from the last 30 years, we can forcast future developments. It depicts a rapid correction of Infant Mortality Rates, Due to the historic gender disparity of infant mortality, and recent success of current programs. It is predicted that, if current trends continue:
            <ul>
            <li>By <em class="em"> 2022 </em>, the rate at which infant girls and boys die will be even.</li>
            <li>By <em class="em"> 2033 </em>, the rate will reach the median rate of 120 boys per 100 girls dying.</li>
            </ul>
            Such a change would require the <em class="em"> abolition of the dowry system </em>, and the <em class="em"> dismanting of the ingrained social roles and status of Women in India. </em>

                <h3>What the GII Comparison Shows:</h3>
                <p>
                The Gender Inequality Index is constructed using metrics of Female Reproductive health, and rates of female education, political participation, and work in comparison to men. While there exists a correlation between gender inequality, the specific cultural manifestations of patriarchy within India are responsible for its higher Female Infant Mortality.
                <br><br>
                <em> The Dowry: </em> The dowry system, requires the family of the bride to transfer assets and goods to the family of the groom; unique to South Asia. While banned in India, it remains a <i>“pervasive phenomenon”</i> [3], that since Indian Independence has continued to expand its presence and grow in the amount demanded. This cost, in combination to wedding expenses taken on by the bride side <i>“often adds up to their life savings”</i> [4] -- hence detrimental for poor families.
                <br><br>
                
                <em> Religious Social Roles: </em> The system of hypergamy, requiring women to marry into higher castes, has enforced female infanticide for those of higher castes. Additionally, the Hindu belief that “Only a son can light the funeral pyre of his parents” [2], demand having a son in the family – leading to an estimated 30% of Indian families resorting to sex-selection to ensure their last birth is a son [5].
                <br><br><br>
                </p>
                <h3>What the Sex Ratio at Birth Comparison Shows:</h3>
                <p>
                The Sex Ratio at birth metric is affected by Sex-Selective Abortion, rather than Infanticide. The negative correlation between the two is the result of sex-selective abortion replacing the historical precedent for Infanticide.S
                <br><br>
                <em> Prenatal Diagnostic Technology: </em> In the 1980’s, Amniocentesis and Ultrasound technologies allowed for the identification of gender before birth. In the case of South Korea, this led to an increase in sex-selective abortions, causing the Sex Ratio at birth to be heavily male sided, while not being reflected in Infant mortality data. In India however, the lack of medical services in rural areas and for the urban poor have maintained Infanticide as a sex selection method. 
                <br><br>
                <em> Mechanisation of Agriculture: </em> The same period saw the displacement of the traditional work of rural women with capital, making <i>“women's occupations increasingly impermanent and casualized”</i> [6]. Additionally, land reform redistributed land to male heads of the family, thereby alienating women from the means of production. Together, <i>“women become liabilities”</i> [7], deepening the loss of women's agency and importance of the dowry.
