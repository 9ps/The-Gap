        The Hidden Reality of Female Infanticide in India

        In early infancy,
        <q>girls have a biological advantage against many causes of death</q>.
        <sup><a href="#bio">[1]</a></sup> These universal biological factors
        mean that girls tend to have a higher chance of living to the age of
        five than boys; globally in 2019, a 96.45% and 96.02% survival rate
        for boys and girls respectively.

      <p> 
        Yet India dramatically bucks away from this trend, the divergence
        between male and female mortality rates
        <em>4.3 standard deviations</em> from the mean. It is one of two
        countries where the female infant mortality rate is higher than the
        male.
      </p>
      <p>
        While other countries have had infant mortality rates that privilege 
        boys, none have remained consistently high as India. In conventional 
        measures of Infant Mortality Rates, this reality is hidden, where India 
        has a less concerning 135 / 195 ranking.

      <p>
        The trajectory of India’s infant mortality gender disparity, saw a
        worsening in the 1990’s from an already low historic baseline. It
        reached its
        <em

          increasing.</em

        This is unlike the rest of the world, where historic gender disparities
        in infant mortality recovered by 1980 at the latest.

      <p>
        The quote above reveals how many separate factors contribute to the
        continuation of female infantacide, to the point where having a girl is
        unthinkable. While some contributing factors are shared by other
        countries, the exaggerated extent of the practice within India is
        contingent on the social and economic enforcement of patriarchy, that
        has been supported by technological advances.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>The Gender Inequality Index</em> is constructed using metrics of
        Female Reproductive health, and rates of female education, political
        participation, and work in comparison to men. While there exists a
        correlation between gender inequality, the specific cultural
        manifestations of patriarchy within India are responsible for its higher
        Female Infant Mortality.

        <p>
          The dowry system requires the family of the bride to transfer assets
          and goods to the family of the groom; unique to South Asia. While
          banned in India, it remains a <q>pervasive phenomenon</q>
          <sup><a href="#bio">[3]</a></sup
          >, that since Indian Independence has continued to expand its presence
          and grow in the amount demanded. This cost, in combination to wedding
          expenses taken on by the bride side
          <q>often adds up to their life savings</q>
          <sup><a href="#bio">[4]</a></sup> - hence detrimental for poor

        <p>
          The system of hypergamy, requiring women to marry into higher castes,
          has enforced female infanticide for those of higher castes.
          Additionally, the Hindu belief that <q>Only a son can light the funeral
          pyre of his parents</q> <sup><a href="#bio">[2]</a></sup
          >, demand having a son in the family – leading to an estimated 30% of
          Indian families resorting to sex-selection to ensure their last birth
          is a son <sup><a href="#bio">[5]</a></sup
          >.

      </details>

      <p>
        <em>The Sex Ratio at Birth</em> metric is affected by Sex-Selective
        Abortion, rather than Infanticide. The negative correlation between the
        two is the result of sex-selective abortion replacing the historical
        precedent for Infanticide.

          In the 1980’s, Amniocentesis and Ultrasound technologies allowed for
          the identification of gender before birth. In the case of South Korea,
          this led to an increase in sex-selective abortions, causing the Sex
          Ratio at birth to be heavily male sided, while not being reflected in
          Infant mortality data. In India however, the lack of medical services
          in rural areas and for the urban poor have maintained Infanticide as a
          sex selection method.

      <p>
        Solutions to the disparity require means to dismantle systems of
        oppression and incentivise girls' lives. Solutions need to address the
        ingrained social norms that uniquely continue inequality - counteract
        the dowry system, provide women and girls with greater agency and power.

            Such as the prevention of ultrasound gender identification, banning

        Looking at trends from the last 30 years, we can forcast future
        developments. It depicts a rapid correction of Infant Mortality Rates,
        Due to the historic gender disparity of infant mortality, and recent
        success of current programs. It is predicted that, if current trends
        continue:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          By <em>2022</em>, the rate at which infant girls and boys die will be
          even.
        </li>
        <li>
          By <em>2033</em>, the rate will reach the median rate of 120 boys per
          100 girls dying.
