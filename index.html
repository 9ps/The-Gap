            <h2>The Hidden Reality of Female Infanticide in India</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="t a_text">
            <p><br>
            In early infancy, <i> “girls have a biological advantage against many causes of death” (Sawyer) </i>. These universal biological factors mean that girls tend to have a higher chance of living to the age of five than boys.
            <br><br>
            Yet India dramatically bucks away from this trend, the divergence between male and female mortality rates <em> 4.3 standard deviations </em> from the mean. It is <em> one of two countries </em> where the female infant mortality rate is higher than the male. In conventional measures of Infant Mortality Rates, this reality is hidden, where <em> India has a 135 / 195 ranking. </em>
            <br><br>
            <div class= "note">
            Note: The other outlier is Tonga, with a population of 100,000. It consistently reports the highest male privileging mortality ratio, 8.5 Standard Deviations from the mean in 2019, while no discussion exists of this phenomena in popular literature.
            </div>
            <br><br>
            While other countries have had infant mortality rates that privilege boys, none have remained consistently high as India.

            <h2>The History</h2>
            <p><br>
            The trajectory of India’s infant mortality gender disparity, saw a worsening in the 1990’s from an already low historic baseline. It reached its <em> worst point in 2003, at a time when global gender disparity was increasing. </em> This is unlike the rest of the world, where historic gender disparities in infant mortality recovered by 1980 at the latest. 
            <br><br>
            The metric of Male to Female Infant Survival Rates, outside of natural causes, are affected by:  
            <ul>
                <li>A greater tendency for the neglect of girls over boys, leading to excess fatalities</li>
                <li>The intentional killing of infant girls, called <em> Female Infantacide     </em></li>
            </ul>
            </p>
