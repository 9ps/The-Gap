            <h2>The Hidden Reality of Female Infanticide in India</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="t a_text">
            <p><br>
            It’s understood within the global public health community that in early infancy, <i>“girls have a biological advantage against many causes of death”</i> (Sawyer). These universal biological factors mean that girls tend to have a higher chance of living to the age of five than boys. 
            <br><br>
            Yet India dramatically bucks away from this trend, the divergence between male and female mortality rates <em>  4.3 standard deviations away from the mean  </em> (in 2019). Depicted in pink on the right, it is one of two countries where the female infant mortality rate is higher than the male.
            <br><br>
            This is indicative of discriminatory practises that purposefully alter a girl’s chance of survival to meet cultural norms or economic pressures. <em>  Without the collection and analysis of data, this grave injustice would be almost invisible.  </em>
            <br>
            <div class="note">
            Note: Tonga, a country of 100,000 in the pacific is the other outlier. It consistently reports the highest male privileging mortality ratio, 8.5 Standard Deviations away from mean in 2019, while no discussion exists of this phenomena in popular literature. 
            </div>
            <br>
            While other countries have had infant mortality rates that privilege boys, none have remained consistently as high as India.

            <h2>The Factors</h2>
            <p><br>
            The trajectory of India’s infant mortality gender disparity, saw a worsening in the 1990’s from an already low historic baseline. It reached its <em>  worst point in 2003, at a time when global gender disparity was increasing.  </em> Many separate factors contribute to the continuation of female infantacide, individually shared by other countries, but together explain the exaggerated extent of the practice within India.
            <br><br>
            Disparities in male and female infant mortality occur from two factors: a greater tendency for the neglect of girls over boys, leading to excess fatalities, or the intentional killing of infant girls. This manifests into two forms: <em>  Female Infantacide,  </em> the intentional killing of infant girls - because they are girls - and <em>  Female Foeticide,  </em> where an abortion is had due to the baby being female. The latter isn’t reflected in Male to Female Infant Mortality statistics.
